> Success is not the absence of failure; it's the persistence through failure.

Data Structure and Algorithm is a way to practice intuition and problem solving. These skills are highly required in the daily lives.
## Intuition
The basic way to solve any problem is called the Brute force approach. In it usually unoptimized way to solve the problem.

> The goal is to solve the problems in the most optimized way.

This requires to develop intuition to solve the problems with different approaches.
## How to increase intuition?
Intuition can be increased by solving as many problems as you can.<br>

If you're not able to solve DSA problems right away that is expected. Most problems require that you have encountered a similar problem before.<br>
Select a course or an online platform like GeeksForGeeks or Leetcode, and go through the problems. If you can't solve them look at the solutions. Once you have been through a bunch of different sets of problems on a topic of all the difficulty levels, try solving the problems on your own.
## Approach to solve a problem
Most DSA problems are easy to code, difficult to analyze.

- Try to come up with the brute force first.<br>
  When you get a problem, try to think of the most straight forward way to solve it and write it down. We will optimize later.
- Write down several examples for the problem.<br>
  Take various examples and write them down. Write the outputs and try to make observations.
> When was the last time you did something for the first time?
- Observations are very important.<br>
  Do not ignore even the most obvious observations. Try to generalize any formula. make as many observations as possible
- List down the approach.<br>
  List down the approach step by step. Figure out the time complexity and space complexity.
- Edge cases. <br>
  Find the edge cases where your code will fail. Also check if any extra checks need to be put. Check the constraints and see if you've mentioned the correct data types.

*Congratulations!! Your problem is solved!*
